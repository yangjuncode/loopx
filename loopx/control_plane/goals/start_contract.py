Rules:
1. Identity: use verified binding/active contract; a stable unbound host gets a fresh public-safe agent. Existing lanes require explicit takeover plus bind/readback before Todo; never infer peers from Todo/worktree/arguments. Unknown host: `loopx agent-onboard --list-agent-types`.
2. Capability: only `selected_capability_route`; run entry/admission and its later `capability show`; never infer from text/URLs. Capability state owns facts; generic Todos schedule.
3. Todos: {todo_rule}.
4. Writeback: current Todo evidence + next executable Todo, then `loopx refresh-state --goal-id {goal_id}` and quota readback. Chat/model summaries are not durable state.
5. Host loop: after Todo write, activate missing/unknown/stale/type-changed Codex App heartbeat automation, CLI/TraeX `/goal`, Claude `/loop`, OpenCode bridge, Ark one-shot, or custom gate. Else surface the exact pasteable gate; never claim autonomy.
6. Run the returned typed `quota_guard`; finish one bounded segment with validation + LoopX writeback or an exact blocker. Setup/planning/claim is not delivery.
7. Optional features: need, preview, explicit apply. Respect private data, credentials, destructive git, production authority, and review rules.{fine_rule}
