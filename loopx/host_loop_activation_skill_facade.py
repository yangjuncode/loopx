"""Host-loop activation for CLI hosts LoopX reaches through a skill facade.

These hosts share one seam: LoopX cannot mutate their loop surface from the
CLI, so the installed `/loopx` skill facade is the entry and the host's own
turn loop is the driver. The differences between them are small and factual —
which skills root the installer writes to, whether the host owns a native goal
or wake primitive, and how honest the quota claim can be — which is why they
live together here instead of each growing `host_loop_activation.py`, whose
module budget is already spent on the agent-type catalog and identity rules.

Each host's facts stay in its own `*_goal_mode` package; this module only
binds them to the shared packet shape.

    For skill-facade CLI hosts where no direct host-native loop binding is
    integrated, the loop driver is the agent's own turn loop and LoopX gates it
    by requiring every continuation to enter through quota should-run. A host
    that does ship a native in-session scheduler passes ``host_scheduler_note``
    so the packet states that primitive instead of the default no-scheduler
    sentence. A host that also owns a native goal primitive overrides
    ``activation_method`` to name the goal binding. The weaker facade boundary
    remains explicit rather than claiming autonomous heartbeat support the host
    cannot deliver.
